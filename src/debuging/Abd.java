		//Interview Question: How do you debug?
		//I debug by using breakpoint and do step into, step over and step return that's how I debug. what does breakpoint do? the breakpiont allow us to make certain stops in debug mode.
		//when I am in debug mode and code is running it will stop and breakpoint, then I can use step into go line by line to find my problem.
		//what is the difference between step int and step over? Step into allow us to go line by line and if we come across a mothed step into will
		// take us inside that method and if I use step over it will not take me inside the method it will go over the method otherwise step into and step over is same.
